# Music Genre Classification Using Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focused on developing Python-based predictive models to classify music genres. Utilizing spectrograms and histograms for audio file pre-processing, the project employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and regression techniques for classification. A user-friendly interface was created using Streamlit to provide real-time genre predictions.

## Key Contributions
**Predictive Model Development:** Developed predictive models for music genre classification in Python. Pre-processed audio files using spectrograms and histograms, then partitioned them into training and testing sets for classification using CNN and regression techniques.

**Model Evaluation and Optimization:** Conducted comprehensive statistical evaluations of multiple model performances. The CNN model emerged as the most accurate, achieving an 89% accuracy rate, making it the preferred choice for deployment.

**User Interface Creation:** Created an intuitive user interface using Streamlit, allowing users to upload audio files and receive real-time genre predictions based on the trained model.
