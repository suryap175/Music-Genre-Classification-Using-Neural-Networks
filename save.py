'''. A histogram basically depicts an estimate of the probability distribution
 of some variable. To construct a histogram, the range of possible variable values
 gets divided into a series of intervals called bins.     
 
 
spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies found in
 a signal as they vary with time. Spectrograms of audio frequencies are sometimes
 called voiceprints or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot the
 resulting depiction may be called a waterfall. '''
